# github-feature-extraction

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on **automated feature extraction and analysis of version control artifacts** from GitHub repositories. By leveraging **OpenAI’s API**, along with **machine learning, NLP, and data mining techniques**, the system processes repository metadata, commit histories, and issue tracking data to derive actionable insights into software development patterns.  

Many software projects rely on **version control systems like GitHub** to track changes, manage issues, and collaborate efficiently. However, **analyzing trends, extracting insights, and identifying patterns** from vast amounts of repository data is a challenge. This project automates this process, helping developers and researchers gain valuable insights into **code evolution, development trends, and collaboration patterns**.

## 🔍 How It Works  

The system follows these key steps:  

### 1️⃣ **Data Extraction**  
- Connects to the **GitHub API** to fetch **repository metadata, commit logs, and issue tracking data**.  
- Extracts **commit messages, author details, timestamps, issue descriptions, and pull request details**.  

### 2️⃣ **Preprocessing**  
- Cleans and structures raw data for better analysis.  
- Tokenizes commit messages and issue descriptions for **NLP-based analysis**.  

### 3️⃣ **Feature Extraction & AI Analysis**  
- Uses **OpenAI’s API** to analyze commit patterns, development trends, and frequent issue types.  
- Applies **NLP techniques** to detect common keywords, themes, and developer interactions.  
- Identifies patterns such as **most frequent contributors, peak development times, and issue resolution trends**.  

### 4️⃣ **Data Visualization & Reporting**  
- Generates **graphs, trend lines, and heatmaps** for a visual representation of repository activity.  
- Provides **summary reports** on development efficiency, team collaboration, and repository evolution.
